# Introductory-Resampling
Basically an organized and simplified version of what I've learned in UW STAT 403.
The "Project" file includes all the codes for our final project for STAT 403, Group 1, 2017 spring quarter.
Group members: Danni Shi(group leader), Xiaoyan (Kelly) Peng, Baichuan (Forrest) Zhang, Yi (Alan) Zhang.
This is a graded and reviewed project.

I will update some codes about the course materials as well.
